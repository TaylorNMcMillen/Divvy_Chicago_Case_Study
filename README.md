# Divvy_Chicago_Case_Study

This case study uses cycling data from Divvy, a Chicago based cycling company! 
The data I used was for each month of the 2022 year [found here](https://divvybikes.com/system-data). 

The objective of this study was to try to create a plan for effectively converting casual riders into paying for membership subscriptions.
