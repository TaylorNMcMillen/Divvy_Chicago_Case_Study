# Divvy_Chicago_Case_Study

This case study uses cycling data from Divvy, a Chicago based cycling rental company, for each month of the 2022 year [found here](https://divvybikes.com/system-data). The main reason for this study is to try to find an effective way to convert more casual riders into paying for memberships.
